Physical music generation and playback

* Write music onto a surface
  * Binary data
  * Physical markings on a paper that can be zoomed into
  * First test to see if music can actually read by one of these methods
* Read music using a camera that does automatic playback of what it's seeing
  * Ad hoc mode
  * Continuous mode -> there should be an indicator on the screen (that moves from left to right) indicating at what point in time the current music is playing.
* Can upload music or leave it as is
* Can also play music that wil generate one of the format (call it a "Trace") -> Connect it to a raspberry pi
* Can play multiple traces at the same time as long as they are demarcated (Clash) -> a straight enough line can become a demarcation
*
